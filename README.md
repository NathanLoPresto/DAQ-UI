## OPAMP_GUI

**Objective**

The objective of the project was to create a UI for a general-purpose operational amplifier centered around electrophysiology experimentation. This includes reading data from a host of ADCs, storing the data into hierarchical data formats, displaying the data in real-time graphing windows and assembling components of the project into a single human-runnable script. In tandem with Dr. Koernerâ€™s ongoing project and the electrophysiology department at the University of Richmond, my codebase and overall design would be open-source, making it free and readily usable for the general public.

**Applications**

The applications of this project extend deep into the electrophysiology community. While most current hardware used by research team can run them several thousand dollars, creating an open-source alternative running on a sub $1000 board opens the world of electrophysiology research to smaller Universities and individuals. The subject itself is still in its infancy and creating a more financially inclusive environment for research will propel it into the future.
