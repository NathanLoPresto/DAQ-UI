// Wishbone Reference (from readLEDs)
// Purpose: An example debug bus. This bus takes commands from an incoming
//      34-bit command word, and issues those commands across a wishbone
//      bus, returning the result from the bus command.  Basic bus commands are:
// 
//  2'b00   Read 
//  2'b01   Write (lower 32-bits are the value to be written) --> why commands that write are prefixed with 0x4000 
//  2'b10   Set address why commands that read are prefixed with 0x8000 
//      Next 30 bits are the address
//      bit[1] is an address difference bit
//      bit[0] is an increment bit
//  2'b11   Special command
