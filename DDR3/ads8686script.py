    '''
    NOTE: the default value of the devID reg according to the datasheet is 0x2002. It is located at address 0x10.
        --> However, value read back from FPGA is 0x2. MOSI shows 0x2000 and MISO shows 0x0002.
         This is because the first byte (MSB byte) is for master out slave in and the last byte (LSB) is for master in slave out
        *** To reset a register, ONLY send the MSB value because the chip should send back the least significant byte's value
            for example: the rangeA1 is at an address of 0x4. The reset code is the address shifted left 1 bit (0x8) in the MSB place
            So we would send a value of 0x800 along the wishbone bus and the chip should hand back the default/expected value of 0xFF 
                (unless it was programmed otherwise)
